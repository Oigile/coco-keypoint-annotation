# coco-keypoint-annotation
'easy way' to annotate images in COCO format for keypoints. Can be used to create a data set for pose estimation.

The first file that is uploaded is a file in which someone can see the layout of the coco keypoint json files. Note that I run the java scripts in Java Eclipse Neon.

Later on, I will upload a file in which all the steps which I took are described in detail. For example how the images are annotated, how the xml files are created, how the coco json format looks like for keypoint detection and how to convert the xml files into the coco json format are explained in a lot of detail.

*note that I am a beginner programmer and do not even have a computer science background.
